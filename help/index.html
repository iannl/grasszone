    <h2 id="controls"><a href="#controls" class="fa fa-link custom header-space"></a>Controls</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The controls for GrassZone are really quite simple.</p>

    To sprint or get onto a cart, you can press O.
    </p>

    To see your key count or get off of a cart you can press x. 
    To sprint or get onto a cart, you can press z.

    </p>
    <h2 id="goal"><a href="#goal" class="fa fa-link custom header-space"></a>Goal</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>In GrassZone the goal is to collect the golden grass</h3>
    <p>The golden is located in a very wide room to the bottom right
    of the bridge. All you need to do to collect it is to simply
    step on it.
    </p>
    <h2 id="keys"><a href="#keys" class="fa fa-link custom header-space"></a>Keys</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Keys are found in two forms. Chests and, um keys</p>
    <h3 class="space-24px">Keys</h3>
    <p>To collect a key, you must step on it. You may view the number of
    keys you have by pressing X.
    </p>
    <h3 class="space-24px">Chests</h3>
    <p>A chest in short is just a key that is a solid object. You
    have to bump against the side of a chest to open it and grab a
    key. Chests can be tricky to get.
    </p>
    <h2 id="doors"><a href="#doors" class="fa fa-link custom header-space"></a>Doors</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="space-24px">Wooden Doors</h3>
    <p>A wooden door is probably the first kind of door you are
    going to see. To open a wooden door, walk into it. It takes
    one key to open one wooden door, and the door simply won't
    open if you have less then one key.
    </p>
    <h3 class="space-24px">Iron Doors</h3>
    <p>An iron door is similar in appearance to the wooden
    door, however iron doors cannot be opened with keys.
    An iron door will be open forever after stepping on a
    iron pressure plate.
    </p>
    <h3 class="space-24px">Laser Gates</h3>
    <p>A laser gate is a door very similar to an iron
    door. But in order to open up a laser gate you must
    first find the golden pressure plate, and stand on it.
    </p>
    <h2 id="dangers"><a href="#dangers" class="fa fa-link custom header-space"></a>Dangers</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="space-24px">Spikes</h3>
    <p>Spikes are the most common danger in GrassZone.
    Spikes toggle on and off, unlike some dangers.
    </p>
    <h3 class="space-24px">Venomous Cacti</h3>
    <p>A venomous cactus is not to rare to come by. Running
    into one of theese will end the game pretty fast.
    </p>
    <h3 class="space-24px">Lava</h3>
    <p>Lava comes in many forms such as moats, and pits.
    Sometimes, there are stepping stones on lava, which can
    help you across.
    </p>
    <h3 class="space-24px">Lasers</h3>
    <p>Lasers are very similar to spikes, however
    lasers only go left to right, in a solid beam.
    </p>
    <h2 id="guards"><a href="#guards" class="fa fa-link custom header-space"></a>Guards and Bosses</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="space-24px">Walking Guards</h3>
    <p>Walking guards pace between two squares. An
    exclamation mark will be visible where they will
    be moving next.
    </p>
    <h3 class="space-24px">Coal Guards</h3>
    <p>Coal guards launch coal in a certain direction.
    It was probably their christmas present.
    </p>
    <h3 class="space-24px">Dr. Hanswater</h3>
    <p>Dr. Hanswater fires red bullets in all
    directions. He only starts firing when
    you step on a invisible tripwire. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="space-24px">The Torch Monster</h3>
    <p>The torch monster can be found by going onto the
    screen that shows Dr. Hanswater, and then taking 60
    steps (or less if you are sprinting). The torch
    monster will go away after firing 80 bullets in
    all directions. When it does go away, a hole will
    apear in the carpeted room with the keep out sign
    in front.
    </p>
    <h2 id="other"><a href="#other" class="fa fa-link custom header-space"></a>Other</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="space-24px">Holes</h3>
    <p>A hole takes you between the carpeted room
    and the room with boulders blocking the door.
    </p>
    <h3 class="space-24px">Pets</h3>
    <p>You can get a pet in the main menu by pressing down once,
    and then pressing left. You can press left multiple times to pick
    between a dog, monster, rabbit, cat, or nothing. Pets will follow
    3 tiles behind you, unless you are sprinting in which case they
    will stay one tile behind you.
